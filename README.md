# VEX High Stakes AR Field

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Augmented Reality (AR) field projection of the 2024-2025 VEX Robotics game, High Stakes. This project allows teams to interact with a virtual simulation of the upcoming game's field, facilitating early strategy development and practice, even before physical game elements are available.

## Features

- **Virtual Game Field:** Utilize AR to project the game field directly into your environment.
- **Two AR Models:** Choose from either a basic field model for overlay on existing setups or a complete setup model that includes field boundaries.
- **Compatible with Multiple Devices:** Supports a range of Apple devices including iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches.

## Getting Started

- **iPhone:** Model 6s or newer, or SE (1st generation) or newer
- **iPad:** 5th generation or newer
- **iPad Pro:** All models
- **iPod touch:** 7th generation
